# Lead Management System - Service Layer
## Purpose
The Lead Management System Service Layer provides the core backend functionalities for managing, scoring, and tracking lead activities. This project serves as the bridge between the user interface and the database, handling requests from the front end, processing business logic, and managing data persistence. The service layer is essential for ensuring efficient data flow, enforcing business rules, and maintaining the scalability and flexibility of the application.

## Project Overview
The Service Layer in the Lead Management System is designed to provide a clean, RESTful interface for interacting with the system's database. It includes APIs to support lead tracking, scoring, and analytics, acting as an intermediary that abstracts database operations from the front end. This layer makes it easier to expand or modify the backend without requiring changes to the UI, supporting a robust and extensible system architecture.

## Key Features
Lead Management Endpoints: APIs that allow the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of lead information. These endpoints enable the UI to manage and display leads effectively.
Inquiry Handling and Scoring: APIs for capturing lead inquiries and adjusting lead scores based on engagement metrics. These endpoints provide real-time feedback on lead activities, empowering realtors to prioritize potential clients.
Authentication and Authorization: Secure access to the system with APIs for user authentication, ensuring data protection and controlled access to lead management functionalities.
Stretch Feature - Lead Analytics Endpoints: APIs to fetch detailed lead activity analytics, providing realtors with trends and insights on lead engagement over time.
Stretch Feature - Reminder Management: Endpoints that allow users to set and manage reminders for lead follow-ups, supporting structured, timely engagement with clients.
How This Project Fits into the Application's Purpose
This service layer project is crucial for the overall Lead Management System, as it handles all the business logic and data persistence necessary for managing leads effectively. By abstracting the database interactions and implementing RESTful APIs, this layer enables a clear separation of concerns, promoting easier maintenance and flexibility. It supports the frontend UI by providing a reliable and standardized way to access and modify data, allowing realtors to interact with their leads seamlessly. This approach aligns with the application's purpose of providing a streamlined, scalable solution for real estate professionals to manage their clients effectively.
